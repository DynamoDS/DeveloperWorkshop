# CBW227911 - Control Dynamo from the Web
Radu Gidei
Mark Thorley

Join this breakout session to learn how to build Dynamo extensions from scratch and why they're so powerful. We'll showcase this by building an extension that embeds a web server & REST API inside Dynamo, allowing users to remotely open & run graphs, extract results, add/remove nodes, & more, all from a web browser. 

We’ll start by exploring the structure & concepts of a Dynamo extension through annotated code samples. Using the Dynamo API, we’ll then learn how to build up our extension in a modular way, so that we can collaboratively add new features to our extension. By the end, we’ll have turned Dynamo into a service that everyone at your practice can use by simply visiting a web page.
